# Repository Instructions

## Documentation discipline
- After every functional change (UI, API, parser, business logic, deploy flow), update `/docs/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` in the same commit.
- Each update must include:
  - Date
  - What changed
  - Why it changed
  - Exact files touched
  - Any deploy/runtime impact
- If no documentation update was made, treat the task as incomplete.
